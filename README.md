Alfred Workflows
================

A few useful workflows I build for my own needs, feel free to appropriate and customize.

Script might not be language agnostic, suggestions are welcome.


Switch Retina Display
---

Switch the 15" MacBook Pro display between the default retina resolution and the maximal screen size available in the monitor preferences.


Coding Time
---

Launches somme useful coding tools, then launches Sublime Text and Chrome before rearranging their windows side by side.

On a 15" Macbook Pro, the resolution is also switched to the maximum.

Tweak the script to launch you favorite apps and set the windows split as you need them (currently 4/6 on the MacBook and 5/5 on bigger screens).


Open in Chrome
---

For the times where you really donâ€™t have a choice and need to view something using Flash, this moves the current page from Safari to Chrome.
